- Created `/src/components/atlas/nexflowx-companion.tsx` — NeXFlowX AI Companion: floating pulsing Orb (geometric abstract AI representation) + terminal-style chat panel with contextual AI responses about routing, compliance, marketplace, and infrastructure
- Rewrote `/src/components/atlas/landing-page.tsx` with all new sections:
  - Hero Section: Updated headline "The Context-Aware Orchestration Layer for the Global Agentic Economy", new sub-headline about AI-driven liquidity routing, CTA "Access the Infrastructure"
